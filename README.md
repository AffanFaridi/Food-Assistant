# üçΩÔ∏è Roorkee Food Assistant

**Roorkee Food Assistant** is an advanced, retrieval-augmented Streamlit app that answers any question about food, dishes, restaurants, or menus in Roorkee-using only real, up-to-date menu data.

---

## **Features**

- **Natural language Q&A:** Ask about any dish, price, restaurant, cuisine, or food type in Roorkee.
- **Strict domain focus:** Only answers questions about food/restaurants in Roorkee (refuses all other topics).
- **No hallucinations:** Answers are always grounded in the real menu/context data loaded from local CSV/JSON.
- **Price & type filtering:** Supports queries like ‚Äúcheap pizza places,‚Äù ‚Äúexpensive non-veg dishes,‚Äù or ‚Äúmoderate paneer options.‚Äù
- **Streamlit UI:** Clean, interactive web interface for users and admins.

## **How It Works**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - `New_Feature_And_data_preprocessing.py`  
     Cleans and enriches the raw menu CSV (`Nugget_final_dataset.csv`), adds features like `dish type` (cheap/moderate/expensive) and a combined `tag` column, and outputs `Nugget_New_feature_dataset.csv`.

2. **Data Conversion:**  
   - `data_converter.py`  
     Converts the preprocessed CSV into a list of menu item documents (`Nugget_restaurant_menu.json`) for vector search.

3. **Vector Store Ingestion:**  
   - `ingest.py`  
     Loads the JSON, creates embeddings (HuggingFace), and uploads all menu documents to Pinecone vector DB.

4. **Retrieval + LLM Pipeline:**  
   - `rag_pipeline.py`  
     Sets up the retriever (Pinecone + HuggingFace embeddings) and loads the LLM (MistralAI) with a strict prompt:
     - Only answer food/restaurant/menu questions about Roorkee.
     - Refuse all others.
     - Never use external knowledge.
     - If answer not in context, say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know based on provided information.‚Äù

5. **Streamlit App:**  
   - `app2.py`  
     User interface for asking questions and viewing answers. Shows current date, random food facts, and maintains chat history.
